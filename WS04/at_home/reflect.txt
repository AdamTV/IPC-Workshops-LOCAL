1)The arrays in this program must be declared to hold 10 elements because the maximum number of days the user can enter is 10. This means there needs to be 10 places to hold values for each possible recorded temperature.
2)Parallel arrays are very usefull to store information with correlating data. This is very effective as you can store a lot more information with a lot less code, and precicely store it. The only disadvantage I can think of is that the data in matching arrays becomes dependent on each other, and if one value is wrong, the matching data in the seperate array(s) becomes wrong too.
3)I think the at home portion was just right because it requires explicit use of logic, and was great practice. The more I practice programming the better I get so the more the better!
